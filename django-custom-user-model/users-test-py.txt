The flow of the program is as follows:

    Test Case Setup:
        The test case is defined in a UsersManagersTests class, which inherits from Django's TestCase. This class will test the behavior of the custom user model and its manager methods (create_user and create_superuser).
        The methods test_create_user and test_create_superuser define the tests for creating a normal user and a superuser, respectively.

    Creating a Regular User (in test_create_user):
        User = get_user_model(): This line retrieves the custom user model that is being used in the project (either the default User model or your custom user model).
        user = User.objects.create_user(email="normal@user.com", password="foo"): This line creates a regular user using the create_user manager method. It passes an email and a password. The method automatically handles creating a user with the correct default fields.
        The program then performs several assertions to verify that the user was created with the expected attributes:
            The email should be "normal@user.com".
            The is_active flag should be True (as a normal user is active by default).
            The is_staff flag should be False (since regular users are not staff members).
            The is_superuser flag should be False (since regular users are not superusers).
        It also checks the username field (which might be None if the custom user model doesn't use it).
        The program tests edge cases where invalid or missing data is passed to the create_user method, ensuring that it raises appropriate errors:
            If no arguments are passed to create_user(), a TypeError is raised.
            If an empty email is passed, a TypeError is raised.
            If an empty email and a password are passed, a ValueError is raised.

    Creating a Superuser (in test_create_superuser):
        User = get_user_model(): Similar to the previous test, this retrieves the custom user model.
        admin_user = User.objects.create_superuser(email="super@user.com", password="foo"): This line creates a superuser using the create_superuser manager method. It passes an email and a password, and the method ensures the superuser is created with the is_staff and is_superuser flags set to True.
        Several assertions follow to verify that the superuser was created correctly:
            The email should be "super@user.com".
            The is_active, is_staff, and is_superuser flags should all be True, as these are typical for superusers.
        It also checks the username field (which might be None if the custom user model doesnâ€™t use it).
        It tests for an invalid superuser creation by trying to create a superuser with is_superuser=False. This should raise a ValueError, as superusers must have is_superuser=True.

Execution Flow:

    Step 1: Test Initialization:
    When the test class UsersManagersTests is executed, the Django test runner sets up the test environment and runs each test method in isolation. Each method is run inside a database transaction that is rolled back after the test, ensuring that the database remains clean between tests.

    Step 2: Running test_create_user:
        The test_create_user method tests the creation of a regular user using the create_user method.
        The program checks if the user was created with the correct properties and performs assertions to verify that the values of email, is_active, is_staff, and is_superuser are correct.
        It also tests edge cases where incorrect or incomplete data is passed to create_user(), ensuring that errors are raised when necessary.

    Step 3: Running test_create_superuser:
        The test_create_superuser method tests the creation of a superuser using the create_superuser method.
        The program checks if the superuser was created with the correct properties, including email, is_active, is_staff, and is_superuser.
        It also tests that trying to create a superuser with is_superuser=False raises an error, as this is invalid.

    Step 4: Conclusion:
    After running both methods, the test runner reports whether each assertion passed or failed. If everything works as expected, the tests will pass, confirming that the create_user and create_superuser methods are functioning correctly. If there are any errors or unexpected behavior, the test will fail, and the error message will provide details about the issue.

In summary, the test is checking:

    The correct creation of regular users and superusers.
    That invalid data or incorrect parameters are rejected with the appropriate error messages.
