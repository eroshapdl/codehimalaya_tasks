1. 1st ma url.py ma path yourname ko url banaucha ani view ko yourname function ma jancha.

3. ani, yourname.html file ma jancha.
     The form has:
        action="/yourname/": Tells the browser to send form data back to /yourname/.
        method="post": Specifies the HTTP POST method for the form submission.

Result: The user sees the form and can input their name.
When the user enters a name (e.g., "John Doe") and clicks "Submit," the form sends the data to /yourname/ via a POST request.

4. Handling the POST Request in the yourName View

The browser sends the form data as part of the request body. Django handles this as follows:
Relevant Code:

if request.method == "POST":
    form = NameForm(request.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
        return HttpResponseRedirect("/thanks/")

    Step-by-Step Breakdown:
        if request.method == "POST"::
            Confirms this is a POST request.
        form = NameForm(request.POST):
            Creates a NameForm instance and populates it with the submitted data (request.POST).
        if form.is_valid()::
            Validates the submitted data:
                Checks that the your_name field is present and contains no more than 100 characters (as defined in NameForm).
        return HttpResponseRedirect("/thanks/"):
            If the form is valid:
                Redirects the browser to /thanks/ using an HTTP 302 response.
